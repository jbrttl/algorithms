"""
Before we can model the price of derivative securities whose value depends on an
underlying equity â€” we need to model the underlying equity. Geometric Brownian motion
is a stochastic process that can be used to generate sample paths that the underlying
equity may follow. In other words, we can use geometric Brownian motion to simulate stock
prices.
